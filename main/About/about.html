			<blockquote>"Serena and Steven made my wedding experience unforgettable. I felt well taken cared of at each
                visit and they made sure that I was happy with my dress. I definitely recommend coming to Yes I do."

            <br/>
            <blockquote>"The owners are some of the friendliest people on the planet. They not only listened
                respectfully to my wishes, they immediately wiped away all wedding-dress-trying-on-jitters.
                Showing genuine regard for my personality and tone of my wedding, I found a dress that far surpassed
                anything I could have dreamt of and add the cherry on top that the manufacturer they work with custom
                makes each dress."

            <blockquote>"I made a wrong turn and found this place by accident. Now it feels like fate.
                Serena and Stephen were amazing!! They helped me pick out the best dress for me.
                Serena made sure I understood everything that was happening within the dress. I felt so
                comfortable there and couldn't recommend anywhere else to go."
